# odin-recipes
Recipe Website - Project from The Odin Project

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)


This project is a basic recipe website. 

I have used HTML and CSS to create this project.
