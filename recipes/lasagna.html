    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagana is a classic Italian dish. This one has a twist because recotta cheese is nasty - instead, we will use
        cottage cheese. Try this one out for your next family dinner!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 lb. Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>24 ounce jar your favorite pasta sauce (I like a marinara)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups full fat small curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the lasagna:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded baby Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9 x 13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine the ground beef, Italian sausage, and onion in a large, deep sauce pan. Cook over medium high heat,
            breaking apart the meat with a spatula, until no pink remains. Drain any excess fat off the pan, then stir
            in garlic, pasta sauce, oregano, pepper, and salt. Heat through then reduce heat to low. Allow the sauce to
            simmer while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a fat pinch of salt and swirl of oil (this helps keep the
            noodles from sticking.) Add the noodles to the pot and cook for about 2 minutes less than the package
            directions. Drain noodles then lay them out on aluminum foil so they'll be ready to go later.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the cottage cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt and pepper. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a very scant layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the pan. Top with 4 noodles laid lengthwise in the
            pan. Spread half the cheese on top followed by 4 more noodles. Spread half of the remaining sauce over the
            noodles. Spread all of the cottage cheese mixture on top of the sauce, followed by 3 more noodles. Finish
            with the remaining sauce and cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes or until cheese is melted
            and browned.</li>
    </ol>
