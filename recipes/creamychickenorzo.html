    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my wife and my favorite meals to make. It is the perfect cold weather or under the weather dish!
        If the noodles is your favorite part of chicken noodle soup, this is for you! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/3-inch pieces (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>8 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>2-3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 pound orzo</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium. Once the oil is glistening, add the onion, celery, and
            carrots and cook until the onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1-2
            minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>Once the stock is boiling, stir in the chicken and orzo. Reduce the heat to medium and add the parsley,
            salt, garlic powder, and pepper.</li>
        <li> Simmer until the veggies are tender, the orzo is creamy and amost of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
